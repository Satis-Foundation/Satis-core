Use @openzeppelin v.3.4 for OVM Solc v.0.7.6 compiler

Delete all "address(this).balance" --> which will cause failure
(just modify the files according to error output in hardhat OVM compiler, I only remember Address.sol but there could be more)

!!! I disabled all ETH related function in the smart contract !!!
!!! If WETH (the ERC20 token used as if ETH in OVM) transfer fails, you can try uncommenting the ETH related functions (EXCLUDING address(this).balance) !!!
